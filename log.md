# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 13, 2019 
##### First day of 100daysofcode Challenge. Wish me luck guys. I already learn HTML & CSS before but decide to start over using freecodecamp curriculum and planning to get thecertificates.

**Today's Progress**: Working on Basic HTML & HTML5 using freecodecamp curriculum. Today progress from "Hello World" to Linked to Internal Sections of Page.

**Thoughts**: Getting confuse the differences of tag & element. Other than that, passed the test.

**Link(s) to work**: [adibafatin](https://adibafatin.github.io/hello-world/)
